# Reviewing Data's Long Journey
- NestJS is a web application server. Its job is to handle requests from the front-end and deliver responses based on whichever tools it has available.

# Routes
- The root route of a website is generally the home page.

# Routes Continued
- A route is a pattern of words, often separated by slashes, that points to a specific controller within a web application server. That controller will handle that request appropriately.

Examples:
https://www.sololearn.com/cats
…..would be called the "/cats" route.

https://www.sololearn.com/dogs
…..would be called the "/dogs" route.

https://www.sololearn.com/stores/manage
…..would be called the "/stores/manage" route.

# GET vs POST
GET routes are generally to GET data from a server.
POST routes are generally to SEND data to a server.

# Get vs Post Requests
- The http verbs "GET" and "POST" are derived from the associated English verbs that they were derived from. "Get" is associated with retrieving something from a resource, where "Post" is associated with putting something into a place. When you "post" a parcel, you are sending it to a recipient, where "getting" a parcel means that you are receiving a package.
